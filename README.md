# base Image

The department of »Kunstgeschichte« needs a web-based photo organizing system for its teaching activity. In the system it is possible to import images, save corresponding metadata and organize them in collections. Further, the system provides a full-text search with filters and users can create and export PowerPoint-presentations. Students have view-access to the presentations of their courses.
